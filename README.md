#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic process of applying software principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-end quality software systems. Software Engineering is very significant in the tech-industry because it enables the creation of software applications and systems that continuously enrich various aspects of modern life, such as communication, commerce, transportation, entertainment, healthcare, and sustainable development.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Key milestones in Software Engineering include the establishment or development of programming languages such as the first programming language called Fortran in 1947, the establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning: Defining the project scope, objectives, and feasibility. Identifying potential risks and allocating resources. Creating the project timeline and budget.
2.Requirements: Gathering detailed information on what the software should do and documenting user needs. Identifying functional and non-functional requirements. Documenting and validating requirements with stakeholders.
3.Design: Creating the architecture of the software(both high-level and low-level design).Designing systems interfaces and choosing the right technologies and tools.
4.Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
5.Testing: Verifying that the system works as intended and meets requirements. Conducting various tests to ensure that software meets quality standards and functional requirements. Identifying and fixing bugs.
6.Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers and providing user training if needed.
7.Maintenance: Addressing any post-deployment issues, implementing updates and improvements based on user feedback. Ensuring security patches and system performance monitoring.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear, sequential process where each phase (like requirement gathering, design, development, testing, and deployment) must be completed before moving to the next. This method works best for projects with well-defined requirements and a clear end goal, such as building a hospital management system where regulatory compliance and thorough documentation are essential. In contrast, Agile is an iterative, flexible approach that emphasizes collaboration, continuous feedback, and adaptability. Agile breaks work into smaller cycles called sprints, allowing teams to adjust to changing requirements and deliver incremental updates. This makes Agile ideal for dynamic projects like developing a mobile app where user feedback and evolving features shape the final product.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developers are mainly resposible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
A Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for ensuring the quality of software products by designing and executing test plans.
Project Managers play the role of overseeing whole process of software development from the planning stage all the way to deployment.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments(IDES) are sotware tools that are used to write, debug, and test code. Tools such as Visual Studio code, and Eclipse.
Version Control Systems(VSC) are software tools that are used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Tools such as Git and Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Someof the various challenges that affect software engineers include:
Changes to requirements during the development cycle which can lead to project delays.
Tight deadlines lead to pressure and can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical debts that accumulate overtime through shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, can affect future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategical solutions for overcoming these challenges include:
Agile methodologies, Effective communication, prioritization of tasks, and regular assessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing is focused on testing of individual components or modules of software. Its important because it identifies bugs early in the development cycle and ensures that each unit of code functions correctly before integration.
Integration Testing verifies the interactions between different components or modules of the software to ensure they work together as expected. It is important because it helps detect issues in the interaction between integrated components and ensures that data flows correctly between modules.
System Testing means testing the entire system as a whole. It is important because it ensures the system behaves as expected in a real-world scenario.
Acceptance  testing focuses on testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. It is important because it confirms the software meets user expectations and business needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting and refining the input (or "prompt") given to an AI model to achieve the most accurate, relevant, and useful responses. It involves understanding how the model interprets language and using that knowledge to frame questions, instructions, or context in a way that guides the AI’s output effectively.
Prompt engineering is crucial for maximizing the potential of AI models by ensuring that the input provided is clear, specific, and well-structured, leading to more accurate and relevant responses. It enhances efficiency by minimizing misunderstandings and reducing the need for repeated clarifications, saving time and effort. Well-crafted prompts also improve creativity and problem-solving, allowing AI to generate unique ideas, solutions, and content tailored to specific needs. By reducing ambiguity, prompt engineering helps avoid off-topic or incomplete answers and provides better control over the tone, context, and depth of the AI’s output.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Explain web development."
Improved Prompt: "Describe the key components of web development — front-end, back-end, and full-stack — and explain their roles with examples of technologies used in each."
The improved prompt is more effective because it narrows down the broad subject of web development by specifying the key components: front-end, back-end, and full-stack. It also asks for an explanation of their roles and examples of technologies, ensuring the response is detailed, organized, and practical. This level of clarity helps avoid an overly general or incomplete answer and provides the user with more structured and valuable information.
